rails_authentication_for_Song_Blog
==================================

A simple signup/signin form with User/Password Authenticaion. Based on tutorials from this article at: http://rubysource.com/?p=3611

Difficulty in completing the app due to rails version 4.1.5 being incompatible with most of the command syntax. For the app to work fully, rails version should either be downgraded to version 3.2.2 or include the 'protected_attributes' gem to your gem file to be able to use the syntax in the tut. thanks.
